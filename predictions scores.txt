- A precision score is used to measure the model performance in measuring the count of
 true positives in the correct manner out of all positive predictions made.
- Recall score is used to measure the model performance in terms of measuring the count of true positives
 in a correct manner out of all the actual positive values.
- Precision-Recall score is a useful measure of success of prediction when the classes are very imbalanced. 
- Accuracy score is used to measure the model performance in terms of measuring the ratio of sum of true positive 
and true negatives out of all the predictions made.
- F1-score is harmonic mean of precision and recall score and is used as a metrics in the scenarios where
 choosing either of precision or recall score can result in 
 compromise in terms of model giving high false positives and false negatives respectively.
